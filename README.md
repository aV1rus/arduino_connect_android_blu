Welcome to Arduino Connect.

This project should be imported using Maven.

The recommended IDE is IntelliJ but should work on any IDE you chose.

Please do not Commit any of your IDE generated files. (Easiest way is to ignore them from the beginning)
You might find some of my IDE files uploaded but im slowly trying to clean them up so the repo wont have any IDE specific stuff.
